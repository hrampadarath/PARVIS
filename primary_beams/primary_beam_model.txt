Primary beams (or complex voltage patterns) of the SKA1-MID dishes have been provided by the SKA Dish Consortium and used in this simulation. Here I will describe the format and how to turn them into 2D images using Python and Matlab.

Link to primary beams: https://www.dropbox.com/s/pmkck48tc78esda/SKA_MID_Primary_Beams.tgz?dl=0
Important: save to PARVIS/primary_beams

The primary beams are provided in two files in Matlab format:

    Data1.mat - in 10 MHz steps from 660 MHz to 750 MHz
    Data2.mat - in 1 MHz steps from 690 MHz to 699 MHz 


Each data file contains the variables:

    freq = frequencies
    th = theta angles ( polar  angles)
    ph = phi angles (azimuthal angles)
    Jones Matrix = [Jpv Jph; Jqv Jqh], where each Jxy is a 3 dimensional matrix of size length(th) x length(ph) x length(freq)


The v and h refer to vertical and horizontal. Jpv is the vertical co-polarized fields and Jph the vertical cross-polarized fields. Similarly Jqh and Jqv are the horizontal co- and cross-polarized components.

Making 2D plots
----------------

Matlab:

To make a 2D contour plot:

> contourf(u,v,Jpv)

where u = sin(theta)cos(phi) and v = sin(theta)sin(phi)

Note: I haven't been able to verify if this indeed gives the 2D plot. I don't use Matlab!


Python:
see plot_beam.py


---------------------
Using your own primary beams
---------------------
While it is not impossible, it would be difficult. The simplest would be to provide the primary beams in the format described above. Using a different format would require modification of the codes in JonesMatrix.py and sourceVisibility in PARVIS.py.
If requested, I can make to include different, user defined primary beams.
